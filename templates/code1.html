        <p> It has always been a tough choice for students to choose the courses in different
            semesters where in there is the possibility to score good grades apart from the interest
            in the course for a future career. <br> Banasthali Vidyapith offers a variety of disciplinary
            and open elective courses with mandatory courses in the final semester. <br> Hence,
            choosing the courses based on the verbal recommendation from the seniors, instructors, and fellow mates becomes a hectic task.
            To ease this course recommendation process for the upcoming semester, we have developed a system
            that deploys simple yet powerful recommendation techniques. It is a system that takes your input and 
            then, it outputs the top 2 courses that you can choose based on your interest.</p>
